# IpAddress

**TODO: Add description**

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed as:

1. Add `ip_address` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [{:ip_address, "~> 0.1"}]
end
```

2. Ensure `ip_address` is started before your application:

```elixir
def application do
  [applications: [:ip_address]]
end
```
